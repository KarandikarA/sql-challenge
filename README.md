# Sql Challenge

This project was roleplaying as a data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. The job was to find out infomration about all the emplooyes that were employed in the 80's and 90's. 

The first step was to create a entity relationship diagram (ERD) to see the structure of the charts. The ERD below shows the relationships between the variables and was crucial to outlining the database SQL.

The next phase of the project was to use the ERD into actual SQL coding. You had to define the data types, set up the primary keys and the foreign keys. After setting up the tables, you then had to import the various CSV data into each of the tables. 

The last part of the project was analyzing the data. The various analsyis that I did was 
List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

1. Listing the employee first, last name, sex, and salary 
2. When the employees were hired in 1986 and their first and last name. 
3. listing the department managers with their department numbers, name, first and last na,e. 
4. Which departments the employees were associated with with their employee number, first and last name. 
5. identifying employees with the first name, Hercules and which one had the last name beginning with the letter B. Their first and last names were listed along with their sex. 
6. Listing all the employees in the sales department with their  employee number, last name, and first name.
7. Listing all the employees in both the Sales and Development departments with their  employee number, last name, and first name.
8. What the frequency count of the employees last names was and listing the nubmer who had the same last name in a descending order. 

For the project, I attended one study session on Wednesday, August 16th at 5:30pm with Justin Moore where I got help with multiple problems with my challenge. In addition, I used stack overflow to help me when I had problems getting the sql to work. I also used the module directions to help me do the challenge. For the ERD diagram, I used the QuickDBD tool.
